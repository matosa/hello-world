Hello! I'm supposed to write about myself, but I prefer to talk about turtles. Here are some turtle facts that are 100% false:

1. A turtle's name will tell you its age. When a turtle reaches the age of Sam a grand party is held to celebrate that turtle's coming-of-age.
2. Turtles are natural-born athletes and compete in their own version of the Olympics. They don't compete with humans because they have an unfair advantage.
3. Turtles are not the same as tortoises and in fact, find it quite racist that people cannot tell them apart.
